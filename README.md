# **Ethos**
Outputs all screenshots/videos stored on a Gyazo session token's account regardless of whether you have Gyazo Pro or not, which is the scummy business model they use
# **Usage**
1. Download the [**latest release**](https://github.com/5vx/gyazo-exporter/releases/latest) and unpack it
1. Run *main.py* and input your Gyazo account's session token into the prompt that appears when you open the program. You can get it by installing a cookie editor plugin (ie. EditThisCookie) and copying the value of the cookie named Gyazo_Session
2. The script will fetch all your Gyazo images, download them to the "downloads" folder, and set their creation and modification dates accordingly
